#
Condition,Conditions
Conditions are various states that can occur for objects, and are indicated with markers placed on the object.
#
Conjuration
All conjurations have these traits by default; Nonliving, Pyschic Immunity, and Unmovable.

- No player may control two conjurations of the same name in the same zone.
#
Controller

- Exception: Equipment is controlled by the Mage it is attached to.
#
Corporeal
Corporeal objects are normal, physical objects. All creatures and conjurations are Corporeal by default.

#
Damage Barrier,Damage Barriers
A damage barrier surrounds an object and makes an automatic attack against each enemy which makes a successful melee attack against the object it surrounds.

- A melee attack is considered successful if it did not "miss" (for example, due to a daze condition or a defense). 

- Rolling no damage does not count as missing.
#
Damage Type
Damage can belong to a certain type - such as flame or lightning.
#
Damage Type +/-X,Damage Type +X,Damage Type -X
Attacks against this object that match this damage type modify the number of attack dice rolled by X and modify the effect die roll by X.

- An attack cannot be reduced below 1 die.
#
Daze,Dazed
Creature is disoriented and/or blinded. When it makes an attack, roll the effect die at the end of the Declare Attack Step. If the attack skips that step, then roll as soon as the attack starts. If the result is 6 or less, the attack "misses" its target and is considered to have been avoided (even if it is Unavoidable).  In addition, the Dazed creature suffers a -2 penalty to all Defense rolls for each Daze marker it has.  

- All Daze markers are removed at the end of the creature's Action Phase, except for those acquired during the action phase (for example as a result of a counterstrike).

- If creature has more than one Daze on it, roll only once to see if it misses.

- Some defenses may only be used a limited number of times per round, denoted by 1x or 2x.

- Some defenses may not be used against certain types of attacks (melee/ranged), as indicated by the icon above the defense.

- A defender may only use 1 defense per attack, no matter how many it has left.

- Defenses may not be used against Unavoidable attacks.
#

#

Damage that is put directly on a creature. The damage is critical (bypasses armor). 

- Not considered to be an attack.
#
Discard Pile,Discard,Discarded

- When a card is destroyed or discarded, it always goes to the discard pile of its owner, not (necessarily) its current controller.
#
Doublestrike
This attack makes a second attack against the same target as part of the same attack action. 

- Remember; many buffs only apply to the first attack in a sequence, so check to be sure!

- The additional attack occurs during the Additional Strikes Step.

Ethereal
This attack is magically enhanced. It deals full damage to Incorporeal objects (count all the numbers on the dice, not just the 1's). 

- Incorporeal objects can receive effects and conditions from this attack.
#
Extendable
When you cast this wall, you may pay an additional cost equal to the mana cost of the wall, plus the wall's Level, as part of the cost of casting the spell.

- Don't forget the additional cost on top of the cost of the second wall!

- You may place a maximum of two walls, total, in this way (Extendable does not trigger on the second wall; no Ex-ception).

- The second wall must be placed within LoS, but does not have to be in range.
#
Familiar
This object can cast spells. During the planning phase, you may prepare a spell for it to cast (unless otherwise specified; some familiars with the spellbind trait work a little differently)

- Generally, there are restrictions to what types of spells it may cast.

- The spell prepared for the familiar is IN ADDITION to the two spells prepared for you mage. However, your mage will not be able to cast the spell prepared by the familiar (and, likewise, your familiar will not be able to cast a spell prepared by your mage).

- If your familiar dies with a prepared spell, that spell is discarded. (tough luck...)
#
Fast
This creature may take 2 move actions before taking a quick action. 

- It may not take more than 2 actions during a single Action Phase.

- If it gains the Slow trait, ignore both traits (having multiple sources of Fast or Slow does not "stack").

Life. 

- All Nonliving objects have Finite Life.
#
Flying,Fly,Flight
Flying objects can fly! Unfortunately, due to realism, there is rather a lot to remember:

- Flying and non-Flying creatures do not hinder each others movement.

- A non-Flying object cannot declare a melee attack against a Flying objectunless that attack has the Reach trait.

- Ranged attacks can always target a Flying object in the same zone, regardless of minimum range. Flying creatures with ranged attacks can always target non-Flying objects in the same zone, regardless of minimum range.

- When a Flying object makes a melee attack against a non-Flying object, it loses the Flying trait until the end of that attack action. This includes attacks with multiple strikes, such as the Sweeping trait, so you cannot melee attack a non-Flying object and then use the second part of the attack to attack a Flying object.

- An object cannot lose or gain the Flying trait in the middle of an attack action (as the attacker or the defender)

- A Flying creature is only affected by guards when attempting to make a melee attack against a non-Flying object in the guard's zone.

- While a creature is guarding, its quick action melee attacks gain Counterstrike.

- If there is an enemy guard in a zone, then your creatures in that zone cannot melee attack objects in that zone other than that enemy guard. 

- Overrides effects such as Bloodthirsty and Taunt that force a creature to attack a particular creature.
#
Heal,Heals,Healed,Healing
Healing removes damage from Living creatures and conjurations.

- No effect on objects with Finite Life.
#
Hidden Enchantment,Hidden
All enchantments are cast face-down and are kept hidden from your opponent. Enchantments all have a casting cost of 2 mana, printed next to the hidden (closed eye) icon on their spell card. When they are revealed (turned face-up), their controller pays their reveal cost.

- Face-down enchantments do not have the traits printed on their cards, but effects that happen when the spell is discarded (such as Cantrip) still apply.
#
Hinder,Hindered,Hindering,Hinders

If it does, the attack deals no damage or effects to the object, other than to remove all Burn conditions. This is an exception to the normal immunity rules. In this manner, a Hydro attack can be used to extinguish the fires of a burning plant object, even though the attack cannot actually damage or harm that plant
- Execption: The Geyser attack spell may target an object with the Hydro Immunity trait. If it does, the attack deals no damage or effects to the object, other than to remove all Burn conditions. In this manner, a Geyser attack can be used to extinguish the fires of a burning plant object.

Corrode
Corrode is an acid condition which wears away armor. For each Corrode condition marker on a creature or conjuration, it receives Armor -1. 

- Objects can never have Corrode markers on them which would reduce their armor to below zero (any extra markers are immediately destroyed). 

- If an object would receive Corrode condition markers that would reduce its armor to less than zero, instead it receives only enough Corrode markers to reduce its armor to zero, and takes one point of direct acid damage for each excess marker. 

- Corrode has no effect on Incorporeal objects. 

- The marker has a removal cost of 2.

Example: 
A Druid has 2 Corrode markers on her, and a Bearskin. Her current armor value is 0. If she would receive another Corrode condition, she instead receives 1 direct acid damage. She decides to cast Wind Wyvern Hide (which has the same location as Bearskin, and thus will replace it.) When the Bearskin is removed, the Druid has zero armor and thus both Corrode markers are destroyed. Then, the Wind Wyvern Hide comes into play, and the Druid now has an armor value of 2.
