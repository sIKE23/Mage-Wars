#
Channeling
Some objects have a Channeling attribute, which is how much mana they collect each round during the Channeling Phase.

#
Charge +X
Creature gains +X attack dice for its very next melee attack, if it makes that attack immediately after it takes a move action, and moves at least 1 zone.
#
Climbing
As a full action, this creature may climb over a Corporeal wall and move into the adjacent zone. 

- If the wall has the Passage Attacks trait, it attacks the creature before it moves.
#
Condition
Conditions are various states that can occur for objects, and are indicated with markers placed on the object.
#
Conjuration
All conjurations have these traits by default; Nonliving, Pyschic Immunity, and Unmovable.

- No player may control two conjurations of the same name in the same zone.
#
Controller
Each spell or object in the game is controlled by the player who cast it. The controller may use and act with that object, and makes all decisions and choices for that spell or any abilities that object may have. 

- Exception: Equipment is controlled by the Mage it is attached to.
#
Corporeal
Corporeal objects are normal, physical objects. All creatures and conjurations are Corporeal by default.
#
Counter
A spell which has been countered does not resolve. It is destroyed and goes to the discard pile.

- All costs and actions spent to cast the spell are lost, unless otherwise noted.

- If the source or target of a spell changes during the counter spell step (for example by Divine Intervention), then the spell is countered.

- A spell with the cantrip trait that is countered still returns to its owner's spellbook.
#
Counterstrike

- A poison condition.

- Removal cost of 4.

- Cannot affect conjurations.
#
Critical Damage
Critical damage bypasses Armor (Armor does not reduce the damage dealt). Critical damage is shown as numbers inside a starburst on the attack dice.
#
Damage Barrier
A damage barrier surrounds an object and makes an automatic attack against each enemy which makes a successful melee attack against the object it surrounds.

- A melee attack is considered successful if it did not "miss" (for example, due to a daze condition or a defense). 

- Rolling no damage does not count as missing.
#
Damage Type
Damage can belong to a certain type - such as flame or lightning.
#
Damage Type +/- X
Attacks against this object that match this damage type modify the number of attack dice rolled by X and modify the effect die roll by X. 

- Note that - indicates a resistance and + indicates a weakness. (contrary to what you may expect from other games)

- Damage type modifiers are cumulative. 

- An attack cannot be reduced below 1 die.
#
Daze
Creature is disoriented and/or blinded. When it makes an attack, roll the effect die at the end of the Declare Attack Step. If the attack skips that step, then roll as soon as the attack starts. If the result is 6 or less, the attack "misses" its target and is considered to have been avoided (even if it is Unavoidable).  In addition, the Dazed creature suffers a -2 penalty to all Defense rolls for each Daze marker it has.  

- All Daze markers are removed at the end of the creature's Action Phase, except for those acquired during the action phase (for example as a result of a counterstrike).

- If creature has more than one Daze on it, roll only once to see if it misses.

- Removal cost of 2.

- If making a Zone Attack, check only once; the entire attack either fails or succeeds.

- Conjurations cannot be Dazed.
#
Defender
A creature or conjuration which is being attacked. They may not necessarily be the target of that attack (see "Zone Attack").

Some objects have a Defense attribute, which represents an ability to avoid an attack. During the Avoid Attack step, a creature may roll one of its defenses against the attack, and avoids the attack if its roll is equal to or greater than the number printed on the defense.

- Some defenses may only be used a limited number of times per round, denoted by 1x or 2x.

- Some defenses may not be used against certain types of attacks (melee/ranged), as indicated by the icon above the defense.

- A defender may only use 1 defense per attack, no matter how many it has left.

- Defenses may not be used against Unavoidable attacks.
#
Defrost
This is a trait of flame attacks. It will be defined in a future expansion of the game in which frost damage is introduced. For now, it's just there for flavor.
#
Destroyed
A destroyed object is removed from play and is placed in the owner's discard pile. Creatures and conjurations are destroyed when the amount of damage on them is equal to or greater than their Life total. Objects can also be destroyed when a specific spell or effect destroys them.
#
Direct Damage
Damage that is put directly on a creature. The damage is critical (bypasses armor). 

- Not considered to be an attack.
#
Discard Pile
Each player has his own discard pile where he places destroyed objects or discarded spells after they are cast.

- When a card is destroyed or discarded, it always goes to the discard pile of its owner, not (necessarily) its current controller.
#
Doublestrike
This attack makes a second attack against the same target as part of the same attack action. 

- Remember; many buffs only apply to the first attack in a sequence, so check to be sure!

- The additional attack occurs during the Additional Strikes Step.
#
Effect Die
The 12-sided die is called the effect die, and it is used to roll for additional effects for attacks, as well as escape rolls, or other rolls.
#
Elusive
This creature is quick and slippery, ignoring enemy creatures. 

- Enemy creatures cannot hinder its movement. 

- It is not required to attack enemy guards when making a melee attack.
#
Enemy
An enemy object is one which is currently controlled by your opponent(s).

#
Escape Roll
Some conditions or enchantments require an escape roll, using the effect die, to see if you can remove them from the creature they are attached to.
#
Ethereal
This attack is magically enhanced. It deals full damage to Incorporeal objects (count all the numbers on the dice, not just the 1's). 

- Incorporeal objects can receive effects and conditions from this attack.
#
Extendable
When you cast this wall, you may pay an additional cost equal to the mana cost of the wall, plus the wall's Level, as part of the cost of casting the spell. If you do, when this spell resolves, you may take an additional wall of the same name out of your spellbook and place it on any zone border connected to the first wall. 

- You may place a maximum of two walls, total, in this way (Extendable does not trigger on the second wall).

- The second wall must be placed within LoS, but does not have to be in range.
#
Familiar
This object can cast spells. During the planning phase, you may prepare a spell for it to cast (unless otherwise specified; some familiars with the spellbind trait work a little differently)

- Generally, there are restrictions to what types of spells it may cast.

- The spell prepared for the familiar is IN ADDITION to the two spells prepared for you mage. However, your mage will not be able to cast the spell prepared by the familiar (and, likewise, your familiar will not be able to cast a spell prepared by your mage).

- If your familiar dies with a prepared spell, that spell is discarded. (tough luck...)
#
Fast
This creature may take 2 move actions before taking a quick action. 

- It may not take more than 2 actions during a single Action Phase.

- If it gains the Slow trait, ignore both traits (having multiple sources of Fast or Slow does not "stack").
#
Finite Life
This creature cannot heal, regenerate, or gain Life. If the creature gained Life before it gained this trait, it keeps that Life but cannot gain additional
Life. 

- All Nonliving objects have Finite Life.
#
Flying
Flying objects can fly! Unfortunately, due to realism, there is rather a lot to remember; the general principle is 'ignore non-flying stuff'.

- Flying and non-Flying creatures do not hinder each others movement.

- A non-Flying object cannot declare a melee attack against a Flying objectunless that attack has the Reach trait.

- Ranged attacks can always target a Flying object in the same zone, regardless of minimum range.

- When a Flying object makes a melee attack against a non-Flying object, it loses the Flying trait until the end of that attack action. This includes attacks with multiple strikes, such as the Sweeping trait, so you cannot melee attack a non-Flying object and then use the second part of the attack to attack a Flying object.

- An object cannot lose or gain the Flying trait in the middle of an attack action (as the attacker or the defender)

- A Flying creature is only affected by guards when attempting to make a melee attack against a non-Flying object in the guard's zone.

- A creature that is guarding loses and cannot gain the Flying trait as long as it guards.

- Creatures always have LoS to flying creatures, and vice-versa.
#

#
Full Spell
A full spell requires a full action to cast it. It has the full action (hourglass) icon on its casting line, just to the right of its casting cost.
#
Guarding
As a quick action a creature can choose to guard, to protect his zone and gain Counterstrike.

- While a creature is guarding, its quick action melee attacks gain Counterstrike.

- If there is an enemy guard in a zone, then your creatures in that zone cannot melee attack objects in that zone other than that enemy guard. 

- Overrides effects such as Bloodthirsty and Taunt that force a creature to attack a particular creature.
#
Heal
Healing removes damage from Living creatures and conjurations.

- No effect on objects with Finite Life.
#
Hidden Enchantment
All enchantments are cast face-down and are kept hidden from your opponent. Enchantments all have a casting cost of 2 mana, printed next to the hidden (closed eye) icon on their spell card. When they are revealed (turned face-up), their controller pays their reveal cost.

- Face-down enchantments do not have the traits printed on their cards, but effects that happen when the spell is discarded (such as Cantrip) still apply.
#
Hinder
If a creature moves out of a zone with enemy creatures in it, or if it moves into a zone with enemy creatures in it, it is hindered. A hindered creature must stop moving and cannot take any more move actions this Action Phase. 

- Incapacitated, Restrained, or Pest creatures cannot hinder movement. 


- Flying creatures cannot hinder the movement of non-Flying creatures, and vise-versa.

- Elusive creatures cannot be hindered by other creatures.

- Lumbering creatures are always considered to be hindered.

- Other creatures may ignore an Incapacitated creature, and it cannot hinder the movement of enemies.

- An Incapacitated creature still takes an Action Phase during the round, but it cannot perform any actions during its Action Phase (normally, the action
marker is simply flipped over). 

- Conjurations cannot be Incapacitated.

- Mages are affected by Incapacitation differently. An Incapacitated Mage can still use actions to cast non-attack quick spells.
#
Incorporeal
An insubstantial or amorphous object that is very resistant to damage. All attack dice rolled to damage this object only count the 1s on the dice

Autonomous
This equipment is attached to a creature, and functions independently from that
creature. It does not take up an equipment location. It is unaffected by, and cannot
be modified by; traits, abilities, or conditions of the creature it is attached to.
However, it can be affected by other sources and objects.
If the equipment provides an attack, that attack may be used once per round,
as a free action, at the end of the creature's Action Phase. If the attack is a melee
attack, it must follow the normal rules for guarding; however, it will not trigger a
counterstrike or damage barrier, and will not remove a guard marker from its target.
#
Cantrip
Whenever this spell is destroyed, return it to the owner's spellbook instead of their
discard pile.
Indestructible
This object cannot be damaged, and cannot be destroyed by damage. It can be
destroyed by other effects or abilities which may destroy it without dealing
damage.
#
Indirect
This ranged attack does not have its Line of Sight (LoS) blocked by any walls.
Invisible
This object is invisible and cannot be targeted (there is no LoS to it). However,
it can be affected by attacks, spells, or abilities which do not target it directly,
such as zone attacks and spells. It can also be attacked by damage barriers and
counterstrikes. As long as it has the Invisible trait, it also gains the Pest and Elusive
traits.
#
OR Attacks
Some attacks have an “OR” in their attack bar. For example, Ludwig Boltstorm's
attack bar presents 2 alternatives; the attack can either have the Sweeping trait
or be a Zone attack with the Unavoidable trait. When the attack is declared, the
controller decides which of these alternatives will apply for the attack.
#
Slam
Creature is Incapacitated. When this creature is
activated remove Slam and replace with a Daze condition.
Unmovable creatures receive a Daze condition instead of
Slam. Has a removal cost of 3.
#
Thorg's Taunt
Thorg, Chief Bodyguard can Taunt his enemies. If the
Taunted creature is in a zone adjacent to Thorg, then it
must either move into Thorg's zone, or make a ranged attack which targets Thorg,
if able. If it is in Thorg's zone, or moves into Thorg's zone, then it must make an
attack which targets Thorg' if able.
Thorg's Taunt does not work on Mages, or creatures
with Psychic Immunity. Thorg's taunt will not force
a creature to move through a Wall with the Passage
Attacks trait. If the Taunted creature is required to
take a competing action from another effect (such as
Bloodthirsty), then it may choose which of those actions
to take.
Remove Thorg's taunt at the end of the Taunted creature's Action Phase, or when
Thorg is activated, whichever comes first.

Bleed
This creature has suffered a deep bleeding wound. Bleed only
affects Living non-plant creatures. Each Upkeep Phase, place one
direct damage on this creature. Whenever this creature heals or
regenerates, you may remove 1 Bleed condition for
each point of healing you cancel. Finite Life prevents
healing and regeneration. As such, Bleed markers
cannot be removed through healing. Effects that allow
you to remove conditions can still remove Bleed
markers. The marker has a removal cost of 2.
#
Extinguish
This attack will extinguish fires. During the Roll Dice Step of this attack, reduce the number of attack dice rolled
by X (to a minimum of 1), and subtract X from the effect die roll, where X = the # of Burn conditions on the
Defender. Then, remove all Burn conditions on the Defender.
#
Intercept
If this creature is guarding, and if a ranged attack targets a non-flying
object in the same zone, this creature may redirect that ranged
attack to itself, as long as it can be a legal target for that attack. The
Intercept is announced and occurs immediately after the Declare
Attack Step (and before the Avoid Attack Step). It loses its guard
marker at the end of the attack which it intercepts. Cannot Intercept
a zone attack. Cannot Intercept if Restrained or Incapacitated.
#
Prevention Effects
Some spells may prevent an event from taking place unless a cost is paid. Examples are Armor Ward
and Enchanter's Wardstone. This cost must be paid for each object that would be affected, or the
effect is canceled for that object. You can choose which objects to pay the cost for.
#
Stuck
Creature is Restrained and Unmovable. At the
end of each of its Action Phases, a Stuck creature
may attempt an escape roll: on a roll of 7 or
higher, remove Stuck. If this creature is Teleported,
destroy all Stuck conditions on it. Stuck has no
effect on Conjurations and Uncontainable objects. Stuck has a
removal cost of 4.
#
Tainted
This cursed or venomous attack creates a tainted
or infected wound that will not heal. Tainted is
a poison condition. The marker counts as three
damage, and this damage cannot be healed or
regenerated. The marker has a removal cost of 3,
and can be removed normally by spells or abilities which remove
conditions, even if the Tainted object has the Finite Life trait. A
Tainted marker placed by an attack does not count as damage
dealt by the attack.

Corrode
Corrode is an acid condition which wears away armor. For each Corrode condition marker on a creature or conjuration, it receives Armor -1. 

- Objects can never have Corrode markers on them which would reduce their armor to below zero (any extra markers are immediately destroyed). 

- If an object would receive Corrode condition markers that would reduce its armor to less than zero, instead it receives only enough Corrode markers to reduce its armor to zero, and takes one point of direct acid damage for each excess marker. 

- Corrode has no effect on Incorporeal objects. 

- The marker has a removal cost of 2.

Example: 
A Druid has 2 Corrode markers on her, and a Bearskin. Her current armor value is 0. If she would receive another Corrode condition, she instead receives 1 direct acid damage. She decides to cast Wind Wyvern Hide (which has the same location as Bearskin, and thus will replace it.) When the Bearskin is removed, the Druid has zero armor and thus both Corrode markers are destroyed. Then, the Wind Wyvern Hide comes into play, and the Druid now has an armor value of 2.
#
Devour
This creature eats other creatures! If an attack with Devour would destroy a Corporeal creature, Obliterate that creature instead.
#
Growth
A creature with a Growth condition marker has grown in size. Each Growth marker provides Melee +1 and Innate Life +3. 

- This marker has no removal cost, and cannot be removed by spells or effects which remove condition markers.
#
Ichthellid Larva
A creature with this condition marker has been impregnated with an Ichthellid Larva. When this creature is destroyed, the controller of the Ichthellid Larva marker may choose an Ichthellid creature from his spellbook or discard pile, and place it face down in the zone the creature was in when it was destroyed. This Ichthellid comes into play at the end of the round for no mana cost, similar to how the Reanimate effect works.

- Ichthellid Larva is a poison condition with a removal cost of 5.

- The Ichthellid Larva marker is controlled by the controller of the Ichthellid that placed the marker. A creature can have only one Ichthellid Larva marker on it. 
#
Innate Life +X
This creature has an increase to its Life, which usually represents an increase to size or mass, and bypasses the Finite Life trait.
#
Lifebond +X
During the Upkeep Phase, choose one: you may transfer up to X damage from your Mage onto this object, or you may transfer up to X damage from this object to your Mage, regardless of range or LoS. 

- Bypasses the Finite Life trait.
#
Lumbering
This creature is clumsy and/or hobbled. It is always hindered, and thus it can only take up to 1 move action during its Action Phase, even if it gains the Fast trait.
#
Obliterate
When you obliterate an object, it is utterly destroyed, leaving no trace. The object is destroyed, then it is removed from the game. It does not become discarded or get returned to a spellbook. 

- Any ability or effect printed on that object or attached to it (such as a marker or enchantment) which triggers on destruction, is canceled.

- Other destruction effects, not attached to or part of the Obliterated object, can still occur.

Examples:

- When you obliterate a Goblin Bomber it will not explode.
 
- When you obliterate a creature with an Ichthellid Larva marker, the Larva will not hatch. 

- If you obliterate an opponent's creature, their Valshalla still gains a Wrath token.
#
Obscured
This object is difficult to see. It cannot be targeted from more than one zone away (this is for all purposes - ranged attacks, spells, abilities, etc.).

- Enchantments and equipment attached to the object also gain the Obscured trait (but attached conjurations do not).
#
Reanimate
This creature reanimates upon death. If this creature is destroyed, it is moved from the discard pile to the zone it was just destroyed in, and placed face down in that zone, with a face-down action marker on it. This creature is considered temporarily out of play. At the end of the round, the creature card is flipped face up and is Summoned into play. 

- Reanimate does not occur if the creature is removed from the game when it is destroyed. See “Obliterate.”
#
Reconstruct
Reconstruct is an effect which removes damage from Nonliving objects. It is not Regeneration or Healing, and is not affected by the Finite Life trait.
#
Resilient
This object is incredibly resistant to damage. This object ignores all non-critical damage from attacks. 

- Direct damage and attack effects occur normally.
#
Rooted
This creature is rooted to the ground. It cannot take move actions, and it has the Unmovable trait. 

- It is not Restrained, so it can still guard, hinder, and Intercept as normal. 

- A Rooted creature loses, and cannot gain, the Flying trait.
#
Snatch
This attack can grab and pull creatures into its zone. Snatch is a Push effect, where the object is Pushed one zone closer towards the source of the Push. 
- Snatch has no effect on Uncontainable or Unmovable creatures.
#
Uproot X
This creature can uproot itself from the ground and move freely. When this creature is activated, you may pay X mana. If you do, it loses the Rooted trait until the end of its Action Phase.
#
Vigilant
This creature is constantly guarding, protecting, or sheltering friendly objects. At the end of its Action Phase you may place a Guard marker on this creature, if it does not already have one.
#
Vine Markers
Vine markers are a Living conjuration with 1 life, no armor, and they cannot gain armor. As the Druid, or a familiar or tree spawnpoint she controls, casts a vine spell, you can destroy a target Vine marker she controls as an additional cost to cast that spell. If you do, you may ignore the range of that spell to target that Vine marker's zone, an object in that Vine marker's zone, or a border of that Vine marker's zone.

- Vine markers hinder enemy non-Flying
creatures.

- Any amount of damage will destroy a Vine Marker, regardless of its total life. 

- Can't be targeted by ranged attacks. 

- Any number of Vine markers can occupy a zone. 
#
Zombie
This creature has been raised from the dead. It gains the undead and zombie subtypes. It gains the Psychic Immunity, Slow, Nonliving, and Bloodthirsty +0 traits. 

- The Zombie marker has no removal cost and cannot be removed by spells or effects which remove condition markers. 

- If this creature would be destroyed, Obliterate it. 

- If a creature already has the Slow trait at the time it received this marker, then it also receives a Stun condition marker.

Disable
Disable is a condition that temporarily
prevents an object from functioning. If an
object has one or more Disable markers
on it, it is Disabled. Disabled objects lose
all attack bars, action bars, and non-trait
abilities. (An ability is anything in the card's text box,
except what defines “X” for cards that have an attribute
or mana cost dependent on X.) It does not lose any of
its attributes or its subtypes (attributes include Life,
Armor, Defenses and Channeling). Each Reset Phase,
remove one Disable marker from each object, unless
that Disable marker was placed during that Ready
Phase. For objects with multiple Disable markers on
them, remove only one each Reset Phase. Disable does
not have a removal cost and cannot be removed by
spells or abilities which remove condition markers.
#
Dissipate X
Objects with Dissipate X only last a short while before
dispersing. When an object with Dissipate X comes
into play, it gets “X” Dissipate tokens. Each Upkeep
Phase, remove one Dissipate token. When the last
token is removed, destroy this object.
#
Unstoppable
This creature is exceptionally large, heavy, and/or
strong, possibly animated by powerful magics. It is
virtually impossible to hold or push. This creature
cannot be hindered. It also has both the Unmovable
and Uncontainable traits.
