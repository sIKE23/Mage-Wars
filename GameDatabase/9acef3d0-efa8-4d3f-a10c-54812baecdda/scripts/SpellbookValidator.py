#v2.2.0.0#
Created 30 April 2019

Changelog:
	Sharkbait: 16 May 2020: 
		hahaha.... a year later. Anyways, I fixed the issue with multi school, level X cost spells with the druid.
		This doesn't address mage-only cards for level X yet, but I'm not sure it's super necessary right now.
	
	
	Sharkbait: 15 May 2019:
		Fixed a few errors. The Level X code was causing the level X logic to apply to all training a mage had, not just the 
		school that was trained up to Level X. It has been adjusted now to check for the whole school training first. Subtype
		training was causing an issue where the SBPadd could be overwritten, so I made it part of the if/elif branching scheme. 
		Subtyping was also doing the '/' costs wrong due to only checking for school. This has been fixed with comments near the 
		function explaining.**************WHEN YOU EDIT THIS NEXT, TAKE TIME TO ADD COMMENTS**************************
		
	Sharkbait: 10 May 2019:
		Finished up the first iteration of Level X training. I am pretty sure everything is at least functional for now except
		counting those mages as School mages. Currently, as long as the mage is at least a little trained in that school, the 
		validator will let it validate regardless of level.

	Sharkbait: 30 April 2019:
		Added Combo School-type, card counts, Mage Only
		
	Sharkbait: 30 April 2019:
		Completed all functionality except Combo School-Type, Level X, card counts, and redoing Mage and School only cards
#######'''

'''
validateDeck is the main function of this script. It takes in the deck object from the game when a player loads a deck. 

##########
mageStats
mageTraining
mageName
spellpointsTotal

The above group is taken from the mage stats card for use in determining the legality and cost of cards in a deck by calling the statCardParse function.
##########
spellbook

This variable is a dictionary that lists the training of the mage and the amount of spellpoints available during construction as listed on the mage stats card.
##########
schoolTrn
schoolOpp
mageSubtypeTrnList
mageSubtypeOppList
mageTypeTrnList
mageTypeOppList
comboSTList
levelXList

All of these variables were created to handle weird trainings that weren't strictly "trained in X school". An example is the Druid being trained in Level 1 of 
water spells. Each variable will be spelled out more in the function getUniqueTraining below.
###########
bookTotal
cardDict

These two are the outputs from the cardPointCount function. bookTotal used to be compared to the max allowed and a flag is raised if bookTotal exceeded 
spellbook["Spellpoints"] but it didn't give enough feedback as to what exactly was wrong so that part has been deleted. For now, bookTotal is announced in chat
to allow the players to decide whether to proceed or not until all the spellbook validators are confirmed to be correct. Additional functionality desired would be 
to have the option of listing out the cost calcs in chat so the players can figure out where their count may have gone wrong.
############
Possible redundant or currently unused variables that could use a cleaning pass:

spellpointsTotal - Not currently used. Could be used as a part of a comparison of allowable spellbook points, but I this is unnecessary
mageStats - I'm not seeing this used anywhere in this function, though I'll have to check the other scripts to see if it is. This is an artifact from old code
